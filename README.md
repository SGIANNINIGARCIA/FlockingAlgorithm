# Flocking Algorithm
A program that simulates the flocking behavior of birds, based on [Boids by Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).

## Tools
The program is written in C++ and the GUI was developed using Qt Creator. 

## Usage
The program starts with 100 agents (birds), and the three main behaviors (separation, alignment, cohesion) can be modified using the sliders.
